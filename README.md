# EcoTrack

Our project uses OPENROUTERSERVICE and Supabase in order to manage the map and the locations, and to store our database where all the informations we use in the app are.
We first managed with the map, the logins and the profiles management. 
Then we tried to implement objects into the map and to make routes between this objects.
We also made an association page where all the databases are stored with their logo.
